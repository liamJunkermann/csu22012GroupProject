Feature 1: Bus route and associated cost.
The path finding algorithm that we chose to use for this feature was Sedgewick and Wayne’s DijkstraSP algorithm. We decided to go with Dijkstra because A* would be less efficient for our task of finding the shortest path to a given point. We also came to the conclusion that A* would be more difficult to implement given the requirements of this program.


We used the TST because we are using full and partial word keys as our data structure and as such a TST gives us the most efficient algorithm for our data structure  

We decided to use A command line interface as it would allow for the functionality that we required without over complicating anything by implementing an ultimately pointless Visual interface.
